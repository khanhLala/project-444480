## Business Process

### **1.1. User Management**
* **Registration**: Users register, login, authenticate,... through the `User Service`, which handles core authentication data (username, password, roles).
* **Identity Provider**: Acts as the main service for **JWT issuance** and internal user validation (Introspect).

### **1.2. Profile Management**
* **Profile Creation**: Upon successful registration, the `Profile Service` is triggered to **Create a New Profile** record.
* **Scope**: This service focuses strictly on personal metadata (Full name, DOB, Bio). Currently, only the **Create** functionality is implemented.

### **1.3. Course Management (CRUD)**
* Administrators or Instructors can perform full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the course catalog via the `Course Service`.

### **1.4. Purchasing & Order Flow**
* **Order Initiation**: When a user selects "Buy Now," the `Order Service` generates a primary **Order** record.
* **Order Details**: The system simultaneously creates **Order Details**, capturing Course ID, price at the time of purchase, and associated metadata.

### **1.5. Payment & History**
* **Transaction Execution**: The `Payment Service` processes the transaction, verifying **User Information** (from User Service) and the required **Amount**.
* **Payment History**: Every transaction (success or failure) is logged into the **Payment History** for user tracking and auditing.

### **1.6. Success Notification**
* **Trigger**: Once the order is confirmed successful, a OrderCompleted event is sent to the `Notification Service`.
* **Action**: The service sends a **Success Notification** (Email/In-app) to the user.
